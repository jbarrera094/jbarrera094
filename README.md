# ![https://github.com/jbarrera094](./jbarrera094_emote.png) Hi! I'm Jeisson Barrera ðŸ‘‹
### Freelance full-stack Web 2.0/3.0 and Flutter developer 

![https://github.com/jbarrera094](./jbarrera094_banner.gif)

As a computer systems engineer with an intermediate level of English and high proficiency in databases such as MySQL, Postgres, Mongo and Firebase, I have excelled academically in both university and college. I have over a three year of experience in the development and implementation of an E-Learning platform called Urbanik-Hub, and I have also worked as a teaching assistant and computer maintenance technician.

In 2019 and 2021, I served as a judge during the project selection phase for the regional eliminations of the National Programming Contest for high schools. I am dedicated, committed, and enjoy self-learning, and I am always willing to take on challenges.

My areas of interest include technological infrastructure, information analysis, and software development. I possess a good knowledge of computer equipment and program development, and I am always eager to apply my skills in new and innovative ways.

If you are looking for a highly motivated and skilled computer systems engineer with a passion for self-improvement and a commitment to excellence, then I believe I would be an excellent fit for your team. Thank you for your consideration.
